### Hi there! <img src="https://cultofthepartyparrot.com/parrots/hd/dealwithitnowparrot.gif" width="30px" />

- 🤷 I am foram, a half time full stack web developer, quarter time cyclist, full time food admirer and an orange soda enthusiast.
- 📝 Here i've put demo and things that i have done during my time of learning. **Checkout [FSojitra](https://github.com/FSojitra?tab=repositories)**
- 🍝 Always looking forward to dinner best part of the day and I strongly believe that maggi is way better than ramen.
<!-- - :woman_technologist: I'm currently working on [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge, well i know i'm late at this party but better late than never, self-improvement.-->
